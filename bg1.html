            As you build a website, look at a search box as an element in enabling site accessibility and navigation. The role of a navigation system is not simply to anticipate and respond to what a user might be looking for: It is to “lead” visitors through your site.
            
            In that context, a search box provides an alternative way for people to find things at your site. Search boxes are a more flexible, open way to provide access to your site content. But that doesn’t mean you have no freedom, or responsibility, to guide visitors, even as they look for content through your search box.
